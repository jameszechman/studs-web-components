<p>File input uses a browse button to launch a file selector dialog. Refer to the <a href="https://studs.strongtie.com/components/button">button component page</a> for more information on how to use buttons. While not a part of the file input component, a submit button is usually the final step for uploading a file.</p>
<p>Users can select multiple files at once, as long as page upload requirements are respected. Each selected file will be treated as unique in the file list. If a file is chosen more than once, it will appear as a duplicate in the list.</p>

<h3>Form Submission</h3>
<p>Most of the time, file input will be used in conjunction with a form. This might be for the purpose of attaching supporting documentation in an e-commerce checkout flow, such as a PDF of a purchase agreement. Or, it could be used in a productivity application, such as a spreadsheet of business expenses.</p>
<h3>Standalone submission</h3>
<p>File input may occasionally have a use case as a standalone component. If it automatically uploads upon file selection (without a submit button) or brings users to another workflow (such as modal used to crop or edit a profile picture), then it is critical to communicate these expectations up front for accessibility.</p>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>Errors appear when the input entry, or lack thereof, fails validation. In that case, use an error message and alert icon to describe the error and how to fix it as clearly and succinctly as possible. There are two types of error messages: component and file. Component-level error messages refer to an error affecting the submission success of the entire file input component, such as when the input is incomplete. File-level error messages refer to specific files, such as one that’s too big to upload.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Kinds</h3>
<p>Helper text allows users to accurately understand the file input parameters before selecting a file. Parameters are likely to include guidance on individual file size, number of files that can be selected at the same time, number of files that can be selected total, and valid file types. Valid file types should be listed by their file extension, not program; for example, list “.XLSX” instead of “Excel”, as multiple file formats are supported in Excel.</p>

      <h3>Behaviors and States</h3>
      <p>A selected file can display a ready to submit state or an error state. Both states in the file list are dismissible. Error states will consist of an inline error message beneath the component and a file-level error message in the list.</p>
      <img src="/img/default_upload.png" />
      <p>If designers choose to enhance the behaviors of the component, designs for the base file states can be found in the Figma design panel. While not linked programmatically to the component, these states can be toggled to find designs for loading and success feedback, in addition to error and ready to submit states.</p>

      <p>Button states, such as rest, hover, focus, inactive, and error, can be found in detail on the <a href="https://studs.strongtie.com/components/button">button component page</a>.</p>

        <h3>List File Limitations</h3>
        <p>Clearly spell out accepted file types, file size, and quantity in the instructions. If users are shown an error, be specific on what caused the error and how to fix it.</p>
        <p><b>Do:</b> This file exceeds the 5 MB size limit. Select a smaller file to continue.</p>
        <p><b>Don't:</b> Invalid file</p>
        <h3>Communicate Expected Outcome</h3>
        <p>In general, files are not uploaded until after a form is submitted. Communicate file upload status accurately.</p>
