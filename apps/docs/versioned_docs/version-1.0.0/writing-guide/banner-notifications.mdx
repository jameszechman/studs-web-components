# Banner Notifications

**Purpose:** To convey important information that requires the user's attention, such as system updates, alerts, and reminders.

Banner notifications are notifications that appear at the top or bottom of the screen and can include things like alerts, reminders, or updates. They are less intrusive than modal notifications, but still capture the user's attention.

**Grammar and Punctuation:** Provide actionable information that guides the user on what to do next. Avoid using technical jargon or complex sentences.

**Format:** Be concise, keeping it around 100 characters.

  <h3>Notifications for Systems or Accounts</h3>
  <p>Banners are best used when communicating system or account information that is not triggered by a user action. Alerts triggered by user actions should be communicated through toast messages or modals depending on the priority of the information. </p>

    <div class='wrapper -do'>
      <p class='-do'>Do</p>

  <h3>Keep Banner Concise</h3>
  <p>Banners communicate important information without being to disruptive to the user’s workflow. Present the contents of the banner without saying more than what needs to be said. Too much text makes it more likely for users to ignore the message entirely. </p>
