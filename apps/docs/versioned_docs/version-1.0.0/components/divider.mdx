<p>Divider and table components serve distinct purposes for content organization. Assess your application's requirements to determine which component is appropriate for achieving clarity and cohesion in user experience.</p>
<p>The divider component comprises just two elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Line</li>
<li>Title</li>
</ol>
<img src="/img/divider_anatomy.png" />
<p>It can be oriented horizontally or vertically and may vary in thickness, depending on its type.</p>
<strong>How to Use</strong>
<p>Dividers serve as a discreet method for delineating content into various categories, segments, choices, or components. Often, the same effect can be achieved through judicious utilization of negative space. Hence, employ dividers with restraint, as excessive usage may inundate the user.</p>
<strong>Separating Related Content</strong>
<p>Employ dividers to separate content collections, defining distinct groups and crafting the illusion of contained elements.</p>

</figure>
<strong>Arranging components within a design</strong>
<p>Employing full-bleed dividers proves advantageous in delineating sections or lists, especially on extra-small (XS) or small (S) grids. Here, horizontal dividers were utilized to distinguish between stacks of content.</p>

        <strong>Sizes</strong>
        <p>There are 4 sizes.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Small - 1 px</li>
        <li>Medium - 2 px</li>
        <li>Large - 4 px</li>
        <li>XLarge - 6 px</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/img/divider_sizes.png" />
      <p>All weights are weights are applicable to both vertical and horizontal dividers.</p>
      <p>Position dividers on the right, left, top, or bottom of an element. To ensure balanced alignment and spacing around the dividers, utilize grid gutters and adhere to the recommended pixel dimensions. For medium (M) to 2XL (2 extra large) grids, employ one to two dividers. When dealing with small (S) to extra small (XS) grids, substitute vertical dividers with horizontal ones to facilitate stacking.</p>

        <div>
        <p>There exist two types of dividers: Stroke and Dash. The primary divider comprises a title that is available for the designer to use for labeling a section, while the secondary divider features a 1-pixel border. Both primary and secondary variations can be applied to either vertical or horizontal dividers.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Heading titles</b>
              <div>
                Primary accordion titles wrap when the text exceeds the
                container width, and the row stretches vertically to fit the
                entire title. For this reason, keep headings succinct.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Panel text</b>
              <div>
                When the content in the panel is longer than the viewport, a
                scroll bar appears. Because this is a poor user experience, itâ€™s
                recommended that text not exceed more than a short paragraph
                under each heading.
              </div>

        <div>
        <strong>Verify color contrast for dividers</strong>
        <div>It is crucial for dividers to maintain a minimum contrast on the page they are applied to. This ensures users perceive them effectively and that they fulfill their intended purpose.</div>

        <br />
        <strong>Add the recommended spacing and ensure visual clarity</strong>
        <div>Applying the correct spacing next to dividers ensures an accessible and clear user experience. Also, make sure the text is presented in a way that is not interfered by layout or affects its readability.</div>

        <strong>Dividers should not be included in screen readers</strong>
