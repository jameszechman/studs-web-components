  A content carousel component functions as a slider, showcasing several slides featuring background images and text. It empowers content creators to arrange content within a revolving carousel of slides. Through the edit dialog, creators can generate, label, and arrange multiple slides, while also setting up auto-transitions with adjustable delays.

      <p>The Carousel component comprises a series of slides containing text, images, and calls to action, aiming to showcase multiple pieces of content within a confined space, typically seen in prominent areas like the hero section. While effective for visual engagement and displaying various content types, carousels may compromise content readability and user comprehension.</p>
      <p>If your goal is to prioritize critical information, the carousel might not be the best choice. Users often overlook carousel content, engaging primarily with the initial item, rendering it unreliable for conveying essential information. To ensure critical content is easily accessible, consider placing it outside the carousel where users can readily find it.</p>
      <p>Although carousels serve marketing purposes well, they can also lead to information being overlooked or poorly processed, particularly if not constructed with accessibility in mind. To mitigate these issues, avoid nesting carousels within less visible tabs or pages, limit the number of carousels per page, and keep slide counts within a manageable range.</p>
      <p>Given the complexity of carousels, particularly regarding accessibility, adherence to these guidelines will aid in implementing the component in a more accessible and readable manner without sacrificing page performance. Be sure to carefully review the accessibility section of this component when incorporating it into your design.</p>
      <p>Carousels have the capacity to feature multiple items per slide, with the slide count increasing at specified breakpoints. This method optimizes page space for presenting various content such as products, services, or articles. However, overloading with too many items may overwhelm users, leading to overlooked content or difficulty in comprehending and absorbing information.</p>
      <strong>Content Gallery Carousel</strong>
      <p>At the top of the page, positioned just above the carousel, you'll notice a series of tabs. These tabs serve as navigational tools, enabling users to select specific content categories. Each tab corresponds to a distinct category of content that you can explore further.</p>
      <p>To utilize the tabs effectively, simply click on the tab corresponding to the category of content you wish to view. Upon selection, the carousel below will dynamically update, displaying content specifically tailored to the chosen category.</p>
      <p>For example, if you're interested in viewing specific information related to a product, click on the "Specs" tab. Conversely, if you prefer content related to videos, simply click on the "Video" tab, and the carousel will seamlessly transition to display content relevant to that category.</p>
      <p>Button components for the carousel, inheriting the centered styling, are positioned to each side, floating alongside the content. These buttons are at the discretion of the designer.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there's a thumbnail slider known as the Display Indicator (DI) located beneath the content. Users can choose a thumbnail from below, and the selected thumbnail will appear above in the content section. The DI also features floating buttons for scrolling through thumbnails and viewing smaller versions of the content.</p>
      <img src="/img/carousel_gallery.png" />
      <p>Within this interface, optional smaller components enhance the user experience. Positioned at the top, on both the left and right sides, are labels designed to facilitate navigation. These labels can take various forms, such as text, icons, or other visual indicators, providing users with intuitive cues to browse through the content.</p>
      <p>Moreover, users are presented with the flexibility to incorporate primary and secondary buttons, offering additional functionality and interactivity. These buttons can serve various purposes, from initiating actions to providing alternative pathways for user engagement.</p>
      <strong>Card Gallery Carousel</strong>
      <p>The Card Carousel UI Component offers a dynamic way to present content, showcasing 3 to 5 cards at a time. This intuitive interface streamlines interaction, providing users with seamless navigation through the displayed content.</p>
      <p>Navigating the carousel is effortless: users can simply click on either side of the carousel or use the Floating Action Button (FAB) for swift movement. Clicking on the left side of the carousel prompts the cards to slide left, while clicking on the right side slides them to the right, aligning with the direction indicated by the FAB.</p>
      <p>Each card within the carousel is designed to accommodate various optional elements, ensuring flexibility in content presentation. Users can expect to encounter Buttons for actionable items, engaging Content, Titles for quick identification, Subtitles for additional context, Labels for categorization, and Icons for visual cues.</p>
      <p>Optimal user experience is achieved by displaying a manageable number of cards within the carousel, typically ranging from 3 to 5 cards. Avoid overcrowding the carousel with too many cards, as it may overwhelm users and hinder navigation. Prioritize responsiveness to accommodate various screen sizes and devices. Ensure that the carousel adapts seamlessly to different viewports, maintaining usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones</p>
      <p>Implement progressive disclosure techniques to manage information overload. Display essential information prominently on each card, with the option to reveal additional details or actions upon user interaction.</p>
      <p>Prioritize the visibility of primary content while offering secondary content or actions as supplementary features, accessible when needed.</p>

        <strong>Sizing</strong>
        <p>You have control over the carousel size through breakpoints. This component offers two sizes: one for viewport widths less than 1023 pixels and another for widths 1024 pixels or greater.</p>
        <p>To ensure consistency in the carousel's appearance, make sure all items within it have the same height. If there's variation, the carousel's height will be dictated by the tallest item.</p>

        <p>The primary image browsing experience should be intuitive, allowing users to scroll through the main image gallery effortlessly. Using a Floating Action Button (FAB) should enable users to cycle through the smaller preview gallery, with the leftmost preview image becoming the main image upon paging. The placement of the FAB can be either within the main content section or below the Display Indicator, as per the designer's discretion based on product requirements.</p>
        <p>It's crucial that the preview image paging operates independently from the main image paging. The preview image paging should only affect the Display Indicator, while paging through the main image should directly correlate with the leftmost preview image displayed.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, FABs should appear upon hover over the main image or upon focus to indicate the paging functionality. FAB buttons also adopt the current button design specifications.FAB buttons also adopt the current button design specifications.</p>
