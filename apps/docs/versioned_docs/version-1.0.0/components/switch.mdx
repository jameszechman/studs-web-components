## Usage

<Tables

        <div>
          <p>
            Switches help users choose between two mutually exclusive options.
            They can replace two radio buttons or a single checkbox when there
            is a default setting and an immediate change in the state or
            functionality is desired. If there is no default or if the change
            requires a confirmation, consider using a radio button or checkbox
            instead. Note that the switch component is used mostly commonly with
            system settings and preferences and not used in forms where
            checkboxes and radio button are commonly found.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use a switch when there are only two mutually exclusive options for
            a user to choose from, and when the functionality or preference
            should take effect immediately without an additional submit or save
            action.
          </p>
          <p>A switch is made of the following three elements:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Label:</b> describes the setting or functionality that the
              switch controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Control:</b> shows whether the control is on or off.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Control value:</b> dynamically updates to state the intended
              behavior of the switch.
              <img src="/img/switch_1.png" />
              <img src="/img/switch_2.png" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            There are 2 variants, one that is set to be vertically aligned, the
            second is horizontally aligned.
          </p>
          <b>Selection control</b>
          <p>
            Switches are commonly used for preferences, including system
            functionality and settings. A switch’s label indicates to the user
            what preference, notification, or feature they are activating or
            deactivating. The label for the switch should not update when its
            state changes. Interacting with the switch should cause the setting
            to take effect immediately as described by the label and the
            control.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/switch_3.png" />
          <b>Nested Groups</b>
          <p>
            When a switch represents a group of controls that are related, the
            parent switch should control the visibility of the settings of any
            nested controls through progressive disclosure. If the parent is
            enabled, the children are visible and can be set according to user
            preference. Deselecting the parent switch hides the nested controls,
            causing the undisclosed controls to behave as though they are off.
            Turning the parent control back on would cause the nested items to
            be visible once more, with the user’s previous selections preserved.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/switch_4.png" />
          <p>
            If all nested switches are off, show the parent switch in the off
            selection as well. Turning the parent switch off overrides the
            settings of the nested switches without changing them to the off
            position. On the other hand, turning the parent switch on does not
            turn on each nested switch.
          </p>
          <b>Sizes</b>
          <p>
            Switches come in two sizes: medium (default) and small. Switches
            should match in size and match the relative width of the experience.
            Keep in mind, switches are responsive and will resize when
            transitioning from one breakpoint to another. Recommended breakpoint
            guidance for each switch size applies to all grid densities.

              <p>
                Concisely describe the intended behavior that the switch
                controls. The control label updates to reflect what setting is
                enabled as selected by the user. Only replace the On/Off labels
                if there are more specific labels for the control’s behavior.

                Always be clear and precise in describing what the switch turns
                on and off. Do not frame the label as a question. The label on
                the switch should not change when its state changes. If more
                context is needed, it should be explained in a non-label text.
