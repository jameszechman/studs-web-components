The GlobalBanner component is designed to display important information across the top of the screen. This can include warnings, errors, or general information. The component can be dismissed by the user if it is set to be dismissable.

## Usage

<Tables
  hideHeader
  headers={['title', 'description']}
  args={[
    {
      title: 'Usage and conditions (for acceptance criteria)',
      description: (
<div>
<p>Employ global banners to disseminate confirmations, warnings, or crucial details. It's essential that these banners do not depend solely on color to impart their messages, since not everyone perceives color in the same way. Enhancing each message with both text and icons can significantly improve comprehension.</p>
<p>Global banners typically serve to broadcast system-wide notifications or information that isn't tied to any particular page element. This includes updates on system status, cautionary notices, or urgent globals.</p>
</div>)
    },
    {
      title: 'Style',
      description: (<div>
        <p>Global banners can consist of five primary elements. The only elements that are required are the message background and body text.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Icon: optional visual representation of the semantic type of message.</li>
        <li>Title: Title of the global message for clarity</li>
        <li>Description text: content that relays the intent of the message.</li>
        <li>Dismiss: Optional button that allows the user to dismiss the banner.</li>
        <li>Banner background: color-coded, depending on the semantic context.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/img/global_banner.png" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>There are two alignments available for the global banner component. Left alignment is the default and should be used in all instances. </p>
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>Global banners are limited to semantic colors. Designers should align usage to meaning. Remember that color is not a universal experience, and usage should not rely on color alone to convey meaning.</p>
      </div>)
    },
    {
      title: 'Variations',
      description: (
        <div>
          <h3>Postion</h3>
          <p>Global Banners are positioned at the page's top, beneath the header/navigation, spanning the width of the viewport. They prompt the page content to shift downward, accompanied by elevation styling for contrast against non-white backgrounds.</p>
          <h3>Options</h3>
          <p>Global banners contain several optional modifiers that can be combined to optimize understanding of conveyed information.</p>
          <p><b>With icon and Dismiss:</b> Together can be used to provide more context or to route the user to dismiss the banner.</p>
          <p><b>With icon:</b> Icons provide an additional visual element to clarify meaning without relying on color alone. Icons are included by default and are strongly recommended.</p>
          <p><b>Without icon or dismiss:</b> Minimally, text is required for all message bars. The bar will persistently show.</p>
          <h3>Colors</h3>
          <p>There are three background colors for global banners. Choose the option that best conveys the meaning of the message. Note that specific icons are reserved for use with their corresponding semantic colors. It is not recommended that you use these icons with a conflicting semantic color, as they each have an established, universal meaning.</p>

        <div>
          <b>Capitalization</b>
          <div>Use sentence case within a message bar unless referring to proper nouns. Otherwise, do not use title case and never use all caps.</div>
          <div><b>Do:</b> There will be system maintenance on April 2 2023</div>
          <div><b>Don’t:</b> THERE WILL BE SYSTEM MAINTENANCE ON APRIL 2023</div>

          <b>Past Tense</b>
          <div>Use past tense to describe the status of an action that is completed.</div>
          <div><b>Do:</b> Image uploaded.</div>
          <div><b>Don’t:</b> Image uploading complete.</div>
          <br />
          <b>Message Text</b>
          <p>Because message bars convey important information and can include an inline link or action, keep the message text as concise as possible. Offer additional information or route users to action if necessary.</p>
          
          <b>Punctuation</b>
          <p>Include punctuation in message bars. If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark. Review <a href="https://www.delldesignsystem.com/components/link/?tab=Design#standards">accessibility guidelines on links</a> for best practice information.</p>

            <b>A message bar’s meaning should not be communicated by color alone</b>
            <p>Support the meaning of a message bar with appropriate text or an icon. This helps users who cannot see color, or who are using assistive technology. Any body text must provide an indication of the status conveyed by the message bar regardless of the color used. If using an accompanying icon, its meaning must be visually self-evident and commonly used in that context, such as an error global, check, or warning icon.</p>

          <li>
            <b>Ensure each message bar meets the appropriate level of contrast</b>
            <p>Both the body text and icon must meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 with the message bar background. The message bar component should achieve a 3:1 contrast ratio or greater with the page background.</p>

            <p>Non-urgent notifications can be distracting for people with cognitive disabilities and can be hard to see for those with partial or low vision, since notifications typically display on a separate non-disruptive area of the screen.</p>

            <b>Links and titles on message bars should accurately describe the meaning and purpose of the notification</b>
            <p>All titles in the message bar notification and links, if included, should contain meaningful and descriptive link text. Avoid generic phrases like “Learn more” in favor of more descriptive and unique text, such as “Learn how to change your settings.”</p>
