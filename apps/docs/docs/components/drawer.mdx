  <p>
  Drawer is similar to tooltip and modal but are not used for the same purpose. Identifying the right use case will make the experience clear for all users, particularly for those with cognitive and learning disabilities, or those using screen readers.
  </p>
  <p>
  A drawer can contain different kinds of content or small interactions. It is a secondary content component that sits off-screen until triggered by the user.
  </p>
<p>
Drawers are commonly used to present secondary content, such as contextual information, large filters, short configurators, or optional forms. This component displays information that could be placed on the page, but due to limited screen real-estate or the intention to direct users’ attention, it only appears when triggered by the user. It is not necessary to navigate away from the page to read more information or complete an action inside the drawer.
</p>
<p><b>Contextual Information</b></p>
<p>Drawers are useful for providing contextual information and references related to the experience or current page. This component can display extra information or features that will not take up space on the page, such as shopping carts. In this scenario, users can view information or complete actions related to their shopping experience in a different space, but within the same main page.</p>
<p><b>Simple and Optional Forms</b></p>
<p>Optional and simple forms can be implemented within a drawer. Options like a short configurator can also be the reason for using a drawer in an experience. This way users will have a focused user experience, where it’s possible to select and engage with the options and configurations without having to navigate to another page.</p>
<p><b>Large Filters</b></p>
<p>The drawer component is a good option for holding an extensive filtering situation. Use a drawer where the experience requires many filters options, providing the user a possibility to customize their preferences having a focused experience. This is useful not to clutter the main page with information that is not mandatory.</p>

      title: 'Behavior: Active, Focus, Hover, Disabled, Touch Start, Touch End',
      description: <div>
    <p><b>Interaction</b></p>
    <p>The drawer is opened and closed by pressing a trigger, and it can also be closed by pressing anywhere on the main screen, outside the drawer. When the drawer component is open, an can appear behind it, shifting the focus from the page to the drawer.</p>
    <p>It is possible for a drawer to include a scroll feature in case the content displayed requires it. However, it is recommended to be as concise as possible to minimize cognitive load and to help users get back to their original task.</p>
    <p>A drawer component does not have different states, since the component consists of only a container that holds content, including text, images, charts, or actions. If the drawer contains a footer with buttons, the buttons’ states should follow their standard guidelines.</p>

        <p><b>Layout</b></p>
        <p>Drawers were built to be placed on the right side of the screen, sliding to the left side when triggered, and adding an overlay to the previous shown screen. Drawers are responsive, which means they change their sizes in the experience depending on the screen size. For desktop or mobile’s views, the component will always cover the entire screen height, while its width will depend on the size chosen. However, the drawer’s width will never cover than 90% of the screen.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment</b></p>
        <p>Ensure the primary or secondary buttons within the footer and the header are always aligned to the left side of the drawer. Making sure they are in the correct position is important to improving readability throughout the experience.</p>

  args={[

        <div>
<b>Drawer Header</b>
<p>Be brief and descriptive about the subject or action a user must take. Try to use verb and noun combinations that clearly describe the drawer’s task or purpose. Header length should not exceed one line.</p>
<b>Body Text</b>
<p>Body text length will adjust itself based on the size of the drawer component. Use the space to explain the purpose of the drawer and make the content useful for the user. Content can include imagery, charts, tables, or text.</p>
<b>Capitalization</b>
<p>Use sentence case in headers and body text, unless referring to a proper noun. For buttons, use title case.</p>
<b>Punctuation</b>
<p>Do not punctuate button text or header text. For the drawer body, use normal punctuation rules.</p>

                Any drawers not using a title must still be labeled for accessibility
              </b>
              <div>
                Like modals, drawers require an accessible name, which is provided to users with assistive technology. Using a variant with a title is strongly recommended, since it meets this requirement while providing the same experience for all users regardless of ability. If a drawer has no visible title in the header, it should be labeled using aria-label or aria-labeled by.

              <b>Drawers should follow keyboard focus behavior for modal interactions</b>
              <div>
                For people who rely on a keyboard or assistive technology and not a mouse to navigate, it’s important that focus is handled correctly. As with other modals, on opening, focus should be placed on either the drawer’s back button or the first interactive element inside the drawer as appropriate. On close, the focus should be placed on the element that triggered the drawer. Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/"> WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices </a>for recommended modal focus behavior and expected keyboard interactions.

              <b>Avoid placing critical information in a drawer</b>
              <div>
                Avoid placing essential information inside a drawer. Users will have no prior idea what essential content is within a drawer and are only able to see it while the drawer is open. If you have information critical to the experience or user understanding, place it where it is easier to find and more permanently visible.

              <b>Do not trigger a modal from inside a drawer</b>
              <div>
                A drawer is already a form of modal, so it should avoid triggering yet another modal on top. This can be distracting and cause various problems for accessibility. If absolutely necessary, additional screens can be shown within the drawer, with the user able to move back and forth sequentially.
