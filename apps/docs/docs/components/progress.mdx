<p>The progress indicator offers visual or numerical feedback to inform users about the duration required for a system process to finish. This feature should not be employed for loading or submission actions that last less than five seconds.</p>
<h3>Guidance for Utilizing Progress Indicators</h3>
<p><b>Application of Progress Indicators</b></p>
<p>Implement progress indicators to enlighten users about the duration of processes when an estimation can be provided.</p>
<p><b>Processes Involving System Operations</b></p>
<p>For actions involving downloads, it's often feasible to offer an estimated time to completion. For instance, when the size of the file is predetermined, a progress indicator can display either a numerical value or a percentage to represent the extent of the file that has been downloaded.</p>
<p>In the context of uploads, the availability of real-time progress feedback depends on the specifics supplied to the system regarding the file. When uploading files or images, utilize the file name and its extension as identifiers (consult pertinent details on file input).</p>
<p>Progress bars can be integrated within tables to present an overview of updates or installations. The column header acts as a collective identifier for the progress bars beneath it, yet an explicit value is imperative for each defined progress bar.</p>
<p>Employ a progress tracker for guiding users through a series of steps or actions stretched across various screens to accomplish a task. This tracker should comprise a minimum of three steps, indicating to users their current position in the process and allowing them to move through the stages by selecting any of the steps.</p>
<p><b>Optimal Practices</b></p>
<p>Should a task necessitate more than six steps, contemplate streamlining the task or dividing it into several smaller tasks.</p>
<p>For tasks comprising fewer than three steps, opting for a "Next" button might be more suitable.</p>

      title: 'Behavior: Active, Focus, Hover, Disabled, Touch Start, Touch End',
      description: <div>
      <h3>Animation</h3>
      <p>Animation in the progress bar depends on whether the progress is determinate or not. A determinate progress bar shows an animation that fills the track as it progresses from 0% toward 100%. An indeterminate progress bar shows a fixed bar that repeatedly moves across the track.</p>
      </div>
    },

        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>A progress bar is composed of, at most, five elements:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Label (optional)</b> concise description of the process that the progress bar refers to. The label can be visually hidden, but must be defined for accessibility.</li>
        <li><b>Helper text (optional):</b> assistive or contextual information about the process taking place. Unavailable when using start placement.</li>
        <li><b>Bar:</b> used to show how much the process has progressed for the determinate kind. Indeterminate bars are a fixed size and loop continuously.</li>
        <li><b>Track:</b>: the area that the bar fills or moves across.</li>
        <li><b>Value:</b> a determinate progress bar will show a percentage, fraction, or number to indicate progress.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/img/progress_anatomy.png" />
        <p>Progress bars come in three sizes: large (default), medium, and small. When using multiple progress bars, they should match in size and match the relative width of the experience.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
          <b> Use a clear and concise label</b>
          <div>The progress bar’s label should be short, meaningful, and accurate to the pending action. Avoid using jargon. Technical language should be similarly avoided unless it’s absolutely critical to the understanding of the intended audience.</div>
          <div><b>Do:</b> Downloading</div>
          <b>Don’t:</b> Downloading file
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>
          <b>When uploading, use the file name and extension as the label</b>
          <div>Showing the file name and extension helps users confirm they are uploading their intended file. For longer file names that may impinge on the space for value, truncate the text in the middle so that the extension is still visible.</div>
          <div><b>Do:</b> Progress bar guidelines.pdf</div>
          <b>Don’t:</b> Uploading file
          <p>When labeling each step, identify the general theme of each step so that if details in the process change, the label still makes sense.</p>
          <p>For example, in a checkout process people may or may not need to enter their shipping details, depending on whether the purchase is of a digital item or a physical item, but must always enter payment details. Calling this step "Your details” allows it to either be connected to the payment and shipping details screen, or just the payment screen.</p>

                Including a label gives all users the clearest indication of what’s happening. As users typically read from top to bottom and left to right, placing the label on top means that the text explanation is the first thing they see.
