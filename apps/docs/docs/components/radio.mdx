          <h2>When to use</h2>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://www.delldesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              Checkboxes
            </a>{' '}
            and radio buttons are not used for the same purpose. Identifying the
            right use case will make the experience clear for all users,
            particularly for those with cognitive and learning disabilities, or
            for those using assistive technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the question presents a binary option, or if the user must select
            only one option from a list of five or fewer, use radio buttons
            instead of checkboxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use radio buttons to require only one selectable option from a list.
            All options are visible, which allows users to scan and compare
            options to make an appropriate selection. Radio buttons always have
            a minimum of two options. Limit the number of options to five or
            less for a better user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            This component is often used for questions with binary or opposite
            answers, such as yes or no, or true or false. This is the only time
            that radio buttons may be aligned horizontally. The exception to
            this rule is settings with an on or off option in which toggle
            switches would be a better choice.
          </p>
          <b>Default selection</b>
          <p>
            Although one option in a radio button group may be selected by
            default, consider the experience from a user’s perspective.
            Selecting an option on a user’s behalf may come off as presumptive
            and risks alienating users by making assumptions about their
            preferences or motivations. Furthermore, users may not notice that a
            selection has already been made for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modal's size dictates the button alignment. Generally, they
            should be at the modal's base. In most scenarios, align buttons to
            the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider adding a ‘none of the above’ option to avoid forcing a
            selection. If it’s important that users are able to easily clear
            their selection, use checkboxes.
          </p>
          <h2>Layout</h2>
          <b>Grouping</b>
          <p>
            Radio buttons require a minimum of two options. When listing more
            than five options, consider whether the dropdown provides a better
            experience for the user. Group labels are optional. However, if the
            individual option labels do not provide sufficient context,
            including a group label can clarify intent and help the user choose
            the appropriate option. This is particularly important when
            considering how people using assistive technology navigate through a
            site.
          </p>
          <b>Alignment</b>
          <p>
            Radio buttons are left-aligned and typically vertically stacked when
            there are three or more options. Stacking radio buttons vertically
            makes them easier to scan and read, especially when the label text
            wraps to two lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Radio buttons can align horizontally if there are two options with
            short labels, for example, yes or no. If aligning radio buttons
            horizontally, make sure there’s enough space between the options so
            it’s clear which label belongs to which radio button.

            A radio button is represented by a circle. When it is selected, the
            selection is indicated by a smaller circle embedded within a larger
            circle along with a color change. The group label, sometimes called
            a legend or fieldset in code, gives the user context to make a
            selection. The individual selections have labels describing the
            user’s options.

            <li>
              Because radio buttons require users to select only one choice,
              make sure that the options are clear and distinct. Like
              <a
                href="https://www.delldesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/"

                checkboxes
              </a>, the biggest usability problems for radio buttons come from labels
              that are vague, misleading, or describe options that are difficult
              for users to understand. All labels should be consistent in length,
              tense, and meaning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Capitalization</b>
              <p>
                Use title case for group (legend) labels and sentence case for
                all other labels.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Character length</b>
              <p>
                Radio button labels should be scannable, consistent, and
                concise.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Describing options</b>
              <p>
                Make sure radio button options are organized in a logical and
                meaningful way. Keep in mind that when listing items
                alphabetically, the order will change when text is localized.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Labels</b>
              <p>
                Always use clear and concise labels for radio buttons so options
                are easily scannable by users. Make sure choices don’t overlap.
                For group labels, a best practice is to state the category of
                the grouping.
              </p>

            <li>
              <b>Specificity</b>
              <p>
                Be explicit about the results of a user’s selection or what they
                are enabling or disabling.
              </p>

            <li>
              <b>Tone</b>
              <p>
                Use a positive tone, signaling affirmation, instead of negation
                to avoid confusing users. Use imperative verbs when writing
                labels.
