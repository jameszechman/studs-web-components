<p>Typography is a purposeful arrangement of letters, numbers, and symbols. Effective typography guarantees readability, crisp visual appeal, and a clear organization of information.</p>

<p>The default styles are applied universally across breakpoints, except for displays and headers with breakpoints below 1024 pixels. This customization is highlighted in the responsive font ramp section. It's important to note that styles are not tied to specific HTML tags. An H1 tag can adopt any header style and size, as long as a consistent hierarchy is upheld across the page and your application.</p>
<strong>Utilize Semantic Structure for Headings</strong>
<p>Structuring your content with headings in a hierarchical manner guarantees clear comprehension of page organization by screen readers and other assistive tools.</p>
<p>Start with a single H1 heading and maintain descending order without skipping levels, such as placing an H3 directly under an H1. If visual differentiation is needed between heading levels, employ styling and font weights instead of altering the hierarchy.</p>
<strong>Use the correct heading style</strong>
<p>Don’t use a heading style on text that isn’t a heading as it makes page comprehension difficult for screen readers and users with cognitive disabilities.</p>
<strong>Follow line-height and spacing guidelines for text</strong>
<p>Some people use custom CSS to modify their text for readability. Therefore, it’s important to follow accessibility line-height and spacing standards to ensure all text is legible and readable for those with cognitive disabilities, as well as those with low vision.</p>
<p>All body, subtitles, captions, button text, and responsive H5 and H6 (for extra-small and medium range breakpoints) have been designed with a line-height 1.5 times the font size. For other font styles and sizes, make sure that your designs can accommodate the following user-applied changes without loss of visibility or functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line-height that is at least 1.5 times the font size</li>
<li>Spacing between paragraphs that is at least 2 times the font size</li>
<li>Letter spacing that is at least 0.12 times the font size</li>
<li>Word spacing that is at least 0.16 times the font size</li>
</ul>
